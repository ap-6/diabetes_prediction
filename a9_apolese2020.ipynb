That is, the attribute with the smallest difference between the averages for diabetes negative and diabetes positive patients is not considered in predicting the diagnosis of the patient. \n","* There are other options on how to make an odd number of attributes. Alternatively, I could have found the attribute with the most missing values (a cursory glance seems to strongly suggest it is the Insulin data) and removed that attribute from consideration instead.\n","\n","#Limitations/Future Improvements:\n","One notable limitation is the nature of the data. Some data has missing values, indicated by values like BMI and blood pressure having values of 0. Glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, and BMI all are attributes that occassionally have missing values in the given dataset. As of right now, all patient data is taken as is (which Dr. Marques clarified was acceptable to do in the discussion board) for both the training set and the testing set. \n","\n","There are a couple of ways to deal with this:\n","1. replace each missing value with the average value among all patients that have that attribute recorded\n","2. discard all patient samples with missing values. \n","\n","Implementing either of these options in the future would be a good way to improve the accuracy of the preditor.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UghlRS5TXDS5"},"source":["#Conclusion\n","When using ~340 patient samples to train the program and ~340 patients to test the program, I had 69% accurracy, which seems pretty good. Considering that there are some clear ways to improve the program (mentioned above in \"Limitations/Future Improvements\"), this current accuracy could probably be increased fairly easily.\n","\n","It is surprising how accurate this program is as of right now considering the improvements still possible. For me, a takeaway from making this program is that you do not need extremely complex logic and computation to make a relatively accurate predictor. Of course, this depends on other things too, like the attribute you are trying to predict, but it seems like as long as you have access to a big amount of meaningful data, some sort of useful prediction can be made with it.\n","\n","I found it interesting to perform what seemed to be some very basic form of machine learning. It is not a field with which I am very familiar, so my major takeaways were related to how we used large amounts of data in this assignment to make predictions about the patients. \n","\n","For example, I now know that using classifier values (i.e. the average value between the average value for two different groups, which in this case were diabetes negative and diabetes positive) for attributes can be an effective way to make predictions about given data. \n","\n","I also learned some ways to clean up the data in cases when some fields are missing (i.e. discard the data are replace with the average value for that attribute)."]}]}
